### Rails School Application

Explorer mode would appear to be complete, deployed to Heroku at the following:

Can CRUD all the students, campuses, and teachers you want.  Navigation is rough

Pagination included as a personal effort to figure out some Kaminari
understanding, not necessarily in pursuit of adventurer mode.
