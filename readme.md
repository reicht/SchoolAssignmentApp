Adventurer finished last second, deployed to Heroku at the following:

Java is ugly but functional.  Give me sleep.


#####OLD NOTES::

Can CRUD all the students, campuses, and teachers you want.  Navigation is rough
but functional, creation and edit pages do not feature a return to campus button.

Pagination included as a personal effort to figure out some Kaminari
understanding, not necessarily in pursuit of adventurer mode.
